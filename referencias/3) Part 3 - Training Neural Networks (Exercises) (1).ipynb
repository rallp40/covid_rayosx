    "The network we built in the previous part isn't so smart: it doesn't know anything about our handwritten digits. How to fix this? Well, Neural Networks with non-linear activations work like universal function approximators. So, **there is some function that maps your input to the output**; this mean, that connects both sides. For example, images of handwritten digits to class probabilities like in the following picture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the power of neural networks is that we can train them to approximate this function, and basically any function given enough data and compute time.\n",

    "\n",
    "At first the network is naive (_ingenua o tonta_), it doesn't know the function that mapping the inputs to the outputs. **How train a NN so far?** Simple: we train the network by **showing it examples of real data, then adjusting the network parameters such that it approximates this function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a **loss/cost function**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, **to find these parameters**, we need to know how poorly the network is predicting the real outputs. For this **we calculate a _loss function_** (also called the _cost function_), **_a measure of our prediction error_**. \n",

You can think of this like descending a mountain by following the steepest slope to the base.\n",

    "Gradient Descent is useful for single layer networks; this mean, NN with 2 yers/levels as the highest deep structure. That's why, for single layer networks, gradient descent is straightforward to implement. However, **Gradient Descent is more complicated for deeper, multilayer neural networks like the one we've built**. Complicated enough that it took about 30 years before researchers figured out how to train multilayer networks.\n",

The output then goes through the sigmoid operation $S$ and another linear transformation $L_2$. Finally we calculate the loss $\\ell$. Remember: **we always use the loss as a measure of how bad the network's predictions are**. The goal then is to adjust the weights and biases to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the weights with gradient descent, we propagate the gradient of the loss backwards through the network. Each operation has some gradient between the inputs and outputs. As we send the gradients backwards, we multiply the incoming gradient with the gradient for the operation. Mathematically, this is really just calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights using the chain rule.\n",

    "## Losses in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by seeing how we calculate the loss with PyTorch. Through the `nn` module, **PyTorch provides losses such as the cross-entropy loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`)**. You'll usually see the loss assigned to `criterion`. As noted in the last part, with a classification problem such as MNIST, we're using the softmax function to predict class probabilities. With a softmax output, you want to use cross-entropy as the loss. To actually calculate the loss, you first define the criterion then pass in the output of your network and the correct labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something really important to note here. Looking at [the documentation for `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss),\n",
    "\n",
    "> This criterion combines `nn.LogSoftmax()` and `nn.NLLLoss()` in one single class.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The input is expected to contain scores for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means **we need to pass in the raw output of our network into the loss**, not the output of the softmax function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This raw output is usually called the *logits* or *scores***. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the logits because softmax gives you probabilities which will often be very close to zero or one, but, remember, floating-point numbers can't accurately represent values near zero or one ([read more here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)). \n",
    "\n",

Then you can get the actual probabilities by taking the exponential `torch.exp(output)`.
